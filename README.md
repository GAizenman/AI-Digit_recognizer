# AI-Digit Recognizer

This project is an implementation of a digit recognition model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) similar to ResNet, designed to participate in the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately classify handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset using a deep learning model. The model is built using a CNN architecture, inspired by ResNet, and achieves high accuracy through hyperparameter adjustments and training optimizations. See the competition here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview

### Features:
- Convolutional Neural Network model inspired by ResNet.
- Learning rate adjustment on plateau for optimized training.
- Flexible hyperparameter tuning for device compatibility.
- Easy integration with Kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition dataset.

## To Run the Script:
- To run, first download the datasets from the kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview
- Adjust hyperparameters to work with your device, as well as data and test_data paths for the dataset
- Run the cnn_digits.py script in the terminal

## Results: 
98.467% accuracy
